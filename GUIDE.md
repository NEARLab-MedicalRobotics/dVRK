## Lab configuration and network connectivity
The *daVinci* room of NEARLab-Medical Robotics is equipped with the following devices:
- 1 Patient Cart equipped with 2 functional PSMs (PSM1 and PSM2), 1 non functional PSM (PSM3), and 1 functional ECM
- 1 Surgeon Cart equipped with 2 functional MTMs (MTMR and MTML), and one HRSV pair
- 1 Controller Cart
- 1 Windows PC (named **WIN**) for computation-heavy tasks
- 1 Ubuntu PC (named **dVRK**) for controlling robot
- 1 Ubuntu PC (named **GRU**) handling the ROS framework

IP addresses of the computers are fixed and are the following:
- **GRU**: 192.168.1.1
- **dVRK**: 192.198.1.2
- **WIN**: 192.168.1.3
  
If you connect to the local network via Ethernet, your IP address will be assigned automatically by the router and it will be static. 

Check your IP address by running `ifconfig` in a terminal (Linux) or `ipconfig` in a command prompt (Windows).  

## Requirements 

To send/recieve messages to/from the robot, like joint positions, teleoperation commands, you need to be connected to the local network (wired only for secutiry reasons) via an Ethernet cable. An Ethernet access point is available between **GRU** and **dVRK**; Ethernet cables are available around the room. If your computer does not have an Ethernet port, you can use a USB Ethernet adapter

 **Ethernet Adapter** ‚ûî  üåê [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.it/s?k=ethernet+usb+c&sprefix=ethern%2Caps%2C183&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_3_6)

A ROS framework is the most important layer of communication in the *daVinci* room. Download *ROS Noetic* to access this framework: **ROS is necessary if you need to get the robot data on your computer, including the camera feeds**

**NOTE:** ROS works only on Linux
* If you have a Windows PC: [Install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), a command-line only Linux environment which runs inside windows, 
* If you have a Mac: You‚Äôll need to install a Virtual Machine, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hzji7w882OY) may help you 
* If you have Linux PC: Make sure it‚Äôs 20.04 (Focal)

## ROS network startup
The *daVinci* room is equipped with a ROS network that handles the communication between all the computer and the interfaces. 
To start up the ROS network, run the ROSMASTER node on **GRU**: open a terminal and run 
```
roscore
```

If you open the terminal inside a python virtual environment and `(base)` is displayed before the terminal prompt, you have to deactivate the virtual environment by running the command `cda` before running `roscore`.

Check that the output is correct and that the `ROS_MASTER_URI` variable is set to `http://192.168.1.1:11311/`

To check if a computer is connected to the ROS network, run `rostopic list` in a terminal. If the computer is connected, you will see a long list of topics, most starting with `/dvrk/...`. 
If you are not connected to the network, you will see an error message like `ERROR: Unable to communicate with master!`. In that case, some troubleshooting tips are:
- Check that the computer is properly connected to the local network via Ethernet cable (Ethernet cables become "loose" over time, and they may disconnect by themselves)
- Check that on your computer, the `ROS_MASTER_URI` variable is set to `http://192.168.1.1/11311/`. Do this by running `echo $ROS_MASTER_URI` in a terminal.
  If `ROS_MASTER_URI` is not correct, run 
  ```
  export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.1.1/11311/ 
  ```

- Check that on your computer, the `ROS_IP` variable is set to the IP of your own computer. Do this by running `echo $ROS_IP` in a terminal and compare it with the output of `ifconfig` (by now I assume that you are using Ubuntu or WSL). If `ROS_IP` is not correct, obtain your IP and then run 
  ```
  export ROS_IP=<your IP> 
  ```

## Use the *daVinci* for teleoperation

**Power the robot**: On the back of the Controller Cart, turn on the main power switch and the endoscope power switch, as indicated in the figure
